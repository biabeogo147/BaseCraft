Task:
You do not need to generate coding script, just make the main idea.
- Ensure that your recommendations are **clear**, **optimized for development efficiency**, and **aligned with real-world application contexts**.
- Focus on project ideas that are **feasible** with the specified technologies, but feel free to suggest additional technologies if they enhance the project.

Each project idea should include the following components:
- Project Idea: [Project Name]
  - Project Goal: [Clearly define the purpose and benefits of the project.]
  - Key Features: [List the core features that the project will provide.]
  - System Architecture: [Outline the proposed system architecture, including key components and their interactions.]
  - Suitable Technologies: [Recommend specific technologies (frameworks, libraries, databases, etc.) that are well-suited for the project.]
