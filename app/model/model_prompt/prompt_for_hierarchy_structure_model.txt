You are given a JSON object that represents the structure of a software project, including directories and files. This is an example of input:

{
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "caro_game/interactive_user_interface/index.html",
            "description": "The main HTML template for the user interface, including a header and footer with navigation links. Use template inheritance to enable extensibility in different sections of the game."
        },
        {
            "path": "caro_game/move-making/create_move.py",
            "description": "A Python file containing the implementation of the create move feature, which allows the player to select a piece and its coordinates. Include functions to validate user input and handle edge cases."
        },
        {
            "path": "caro_game/move-making/piece_movement.py",
            "description": "A Python file containing the implementation of the piece movement logic, including recursive depth-first search algorithms for evaluating moves and checking if they are valid according to the Cko rules."
        },
        {
            "path": "caro_game/basic_ai/simple_ai.py",
            "description": "A Python file containing a basic implementation of the AI algorithm using minimax with alpha-beta pruning. This will be used as a starting point for more advanced AIs in future iterations."
        }
    ]
}

From the descriptions, you need to identify which files depend on other files. You should list these dependencies in the output. This is an example of output:

{
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "caro_game/interactive_user_interface/index.html",
            "depend_on": []
        },
        {
            "path": "caro_game/move-making/create_move.py",
            "depend_on": []
        },
        {
            "path": "caro_game/move-making/piece_movement.py",
            "depend_on": [
                "caro_game/move-making/create_move.py"
            ]
        },
        {
            "path": "caro_game/basic_ai/simple_ai.py",
            "depend_on": [
                "caro_game/move-making/piece_movement.py"
            ]
        }
    ]
}:

Note that the paths in 'depend_on' should be the full paths as they appear in the input, and only contains files from input. You cannot create another files.
The dependencies indicate which files need to be developed before others. For example, if file A depends on file B, then file B should be developed first, not appear any cycle.
Your task is to analyze the natural language descriptions to infer these dependencies.
Please provide the output in JSON format.
