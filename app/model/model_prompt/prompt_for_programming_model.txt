You are given an input JSON that describes a directory structure for a project. The input JSON has the following structure:

{
  "files": [
    {"path": "path/to/file1.py", "description": "Description of file1", "depend_on": ["path/to/dep1.py", "path/to/dep2.py", ...]},
    {"path": "path/to/file2.py", "description": "Description of file2", "depend_on": [...]},
    ...
  ]
}

Your task is to generate code for each file based on its description and to include import statements for the files it depends on.
Based on the description, generate appropriate code, such as function definitions, class definitions, or other relevant code. The code should be syntactically correct.
Then, produce an output JSON with the following structure:

{
  "files": [
    {"path": "path/to/file1.py", "content": "generated code for file1"},
    {"path": "path/to/file2.py", "content": "generated code for file2"},
    ...
  ]
}
